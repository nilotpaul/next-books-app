## Content structure :

The structure of your book is completely up to you can customisable as per liking. But there are few things you need to follow.

### Automatic Table of Contents generation :

After publishing the book, in the reader before the actual content starts there;'ll be a dedicated page for table of contents. Now to auto-generated those you need to maintain a particular schema.
\
First, write you book in a general format, let's assume you've written 100 words and you want to keep this in one chapter and create a new chapter and continue from there.
\
To achieve this before starting a new chapter `provide a heading`.

```html title="Example :"
<h2>First Chapter content</h2>
<p>of this chap.....</p>

<h2>Second chapter</h2>
<p>content of this chap.....</p>
```

### Illustrations :

Adding Illustration images is easy as well. Before staring your first chapter add your illustration image. This will create a dedicated page for that illustration.

## Publishing Your Book :

Congrats! on writing your first book. Now let's see the steps for publishing.

Before proceeding make sure to make a book front-cover image, back-cover image, synopsis or description and genres. These fields are required.
\
Now, decide whether the book will be paid or free to read. For paid, please enter the correct amount you want to charge for the book else just stick with the free option.
\
You can now save your book as draft, this will not make it public and you can edit it whenever, after you're satisfied with the result click the publish button, your book will immediately be published.
